This code implements the closed-form solution for Lamb's problem (type II) with large Poisson's ratio (nu > 0.2631)

A sample scirpt (test.m) is included in the package to show how to use the code.

This code is modified from Xi Feng and Haiming Zhang 2018, GJI by adjusting several functions, essentially, UP1.m, US1.m, VP1.m, VS1.m, and VSP1.m.
